# JAL Web Variant

JAL(Just Another Launchers) web variant, porting basic scrappy tkinter interface into something much prettier.

## Description

JAL is in early developement and this git is more just a place to hold its project files for now. This project will always be open source as its aim isn't to be a store for games but rather an extensive libary for them. Allowing a lot of customisation in terms of themes and overall app functionality. 

### Dependencies

Written for windows in python 3.8. No dependencies required further than this is as all modules will be autoinstalled.

### Installing

As of now if you would like to use this(unsure as to why you would in the current state), you can clone the repo.

### Executing program

Launch the app.py. The webserver will be hosted on localhost:5000. More help will be displayed on there on how to use the features.
